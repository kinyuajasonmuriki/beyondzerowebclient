        Fifteen women die every day due to pregnancy related complications in Kenya and 20% of all deaths among mothers in the country are AIDS-related.
        In order to improve maternal and child health outcomes in the country, the First Lady of Kenya, Margaret Kenyatta launched the ‘Beyond Zero Campaign’ on 24 January in Kenya’s capital Nairobi.
         The new initiative also aims to accelerate the implementation of the national plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections among children.

        “I wished that my mother had better access to maternal health care services that would have protected her from contracting HIV,” said Dorcas Kawira, a 21 year old HIV positive law student.
         She also stressed the challenges she experienced in accessing and using HIV treatment during her childhood. She highlighted that investing in the ‘Beyond Zero campaign’ would secure the necessary maternal and child health care to protect her and other young women living with HIV.

        <p class="about-text">The ‘Beyond Zero campaign’ is part of the initiatives outlined in the Strategic Framework for the engagement of the First Lady in HIV control and promotion of maternal,
           newborn and child health in Kenya that was unveiled on World AIDS Day 2013. The framework aims to galvanise high-level leadership in ending new HIV infections among children and reducing HIV related deaths among women and children in Kenya.
         </p>
         <p class="about-text">The strategic framework focuses on five key areas: (i) Accelerating HIV programmes,
           (ii) Influencing investment in high impact activities to promote maternal and child health and HIV control
            (iii) Mobilizing men as clients, partners and agents of change, (iv) Involving communities to address barriers to accessing HIV,
             maternal and child health services and (v) Providing leadership, accountability and recognition to accelerate the attainment of HIV,
             maternal and child health targets
